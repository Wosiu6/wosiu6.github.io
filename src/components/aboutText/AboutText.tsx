        <p>By day, I'm a code-slinging software engineer who thrives in the back-end. When I'm not wrestling with servers and databases, you'll probably find me:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Leveling up (in real life, not just video games!):</b> Gotta stay active, you know? Whether it's hitting the gym, exploring new trails, or just getting some sunshine, I love keeping my body moving.</li>
            <li><b>Geeking out over the future:</b> I'm a total tech junkie, always fascinated by the latest advancements. AI, high-performance computing, you name it â€“ if it's pushing the boundaries, I'm there! (Think Cyberpunk 2077, but hopefully with a smoother launch.)</li>
            <li><b>Building things (not just in code):</b> I love tinkering and creating, whether it's a new website (like this one!), a personal project, or just messing around with new tech.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>So, why React?</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, good question. I like to learn new things, and sometimes the front-end world beckons... even if it involves wrangling stylesheets.
