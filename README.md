# What is this?
This is my website written in React. It hosts my portfolio and other things I like.
It builds and deploys automatically to gh-pages using GitHub Actions.

## The design
I change it like socks. If you do not like it now, visit in 2 months (you probably still won't like it, it's fine, I'm not a frontend dev)
